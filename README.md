### Vagrant

To help simplify the development setup you can run on a preconfigured vagrant box. First grab the latest free [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) client for your OS. Then follow the commands below.

    cd ~/projects/hearno
    vagrant box add hearno https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nm494bm0prfhxr/hearno.box
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    sudo apt-get update #stay up to date on the latest on vagrant
    cd /vagrant #this should put you into the rails app project directory
    bundle exec rails s 
    #Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000, but go to 4000 where vagrant is forwarding
    open http://localhost:4000
